           Although the rate has <strong>declined by a significant 34%</strong> from 2009-2018, land transport accidents were still ranked <strong>9th</strong> as the leading cause of fatality in Australia that should continually be reduced. </span>

         <span style="font-size:15pt"> Fatality rates in <strong><span style="color: #FF0000;">Northern Territory</span></strong> is unconventionally the highest at <strong>9.3 fatality per 100,000</strong>. Fatality rate in <strong><span style="color: #FF0000;"> Australian Capital Territory</span></strong> is just second to them at <strong>5.32 fatality per 100,000 population </strong>, making it a worrying figure as both figures are higher than the national average. The high rates could be brought about by the inconsistent and rocky terrains or even bad driving ethics and therefore it is essential that road safety should be tightly monitored by government and consider building safer road infrastructures for the people there. </span> </p>
       <p style="line-height: 1.2;"> 
         <span style="font-size:15pt">Fortunately fatality rates amongst the denser states like <strong><span style="color: #00008B;"> New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland </span></strong> averaged to be at <strong>2.51 fatality per 100,000</strong>, making it below the national average. 
       It is definitely useful if drivers or travellers are able to take higher precaution amongst themselves and everyone can do their part to reduce the fatality rate moving forward.</span>

     <span style="font-size:15pt"> Fatality rate has been monitored on a daily basis to better reflect the fatality pattern and it comes as no surprise that the <strong>weekend</strong> makes up for almost <strong>half</strong> the fatalities. 
     With an established nightlife and leading towards the weekend, people in general tend to go out for night activities and it is important that government increase their checks on weekends to prevent 
     these prevailing rates to have a better grasp of the road safety issue as it is correlated to drink driving, one of the major leading causes of road fatality.<span/>

       <span style="font-size:15pt"> Since 2000, the age group with the highest % of fatalities has always been the <strong>middle aged group (40-64)</strong>, followed by the <strong>early adulthood group (26-39)</strong>. 
          <strong><span style="color: #675193;">Males</span></strong> also make up <strong>more than 60% </strong> of fatalities in every state. <strong><span style="color: #00008B;"> South Australia</span></strong> recorded <strong>84.61%</strong> of <strong><span style="color: #675193;"> males</span></strong> fatalities in just 2021 whereas for <strong><span style="color: #ca8861;"> Females</span></strong>, 
          the highest fatality rate for 2021 comes from<strong><span style="color: #00008B;"> New South Wales</span></strong> with a record <strong>36%</strong>. 
          Government should allocate their focus on a targeted demographic to improve on road awareness and safety protocols to <strong> reduce fatality rates.</strong> </span>

      <p style="line-height: 1.2;">
        <span style="font-size:15pt"> <strong><span style="color: #CC6677;"> Car drivers</span></strong> certainly made up at least<strong><span style="color: #CC6677;"> 40%</span></strong> of the fatality count with car related accidents for road users while <strong><span style="color: #DDCC77;"> Motorcycle riders</span></strong> make up similar fatality counts as <strong><span style="color: #117733;"> passengers of car drivers</span></strong>, which indicates the motorcycle related accidents are second to car. 
        However, the overall fatalities for these vehicle related accidents have come down over the years which is not so worrying. What is surprising is the <strong><span style="color: #88CCEE;"> pedal cyclist</span></strong> fatalities. 
        Despite it being a fraction of the total fatalities, it is the only road user group that <strong> has not decline over the years</strong> and this is an indication that perhaps government should 
        implement road safety awareness courses as more people are resorting to cycling as a mode of transportation in the recent years. </span>
