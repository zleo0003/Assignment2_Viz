      <h2 style="text-align: right;> Fatality rate across Australia States </h2> 
      <p2 style="text-align: right;> Fatality rates in Northern Territory is unconventionally the highest at 9.3 fatality per 100,000. Fatality rate in Australian Capital Territory is just second to them at 5.32, making it a worrying figure as both figures are higher than the national average. The high rates could be brought about by the inconsistent and rocky terrains or even bad driving ethics and therefore it is essential that road safety should be tightly monitored by government and consider building safer road infrastructures for the people there. Fortunately fatality rates amongst the denser states like New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland averaged to be at 2.51 fatality per 100,000, making it below the national average. It is definitely useful if drivers or travellers are able to take higher precaution amongst themselves and everyone can do their part to reduce the fatality rate moving forward. </p2>

        <h2> Fatality Trend Across Australia States </h2> 
        <p2> Fatality rate is exponentially decreasing over the last 20 years, with close to 1900 fatalities per year in the early 2000s drop to just 1100 fatalities in 2021. There is even 2 sharp drops from 2001-2002 period and even in 2020, providing a positive outlook it shows that government has been ramping up efforts to improve road infrastructures and safety. </p2>

      <h2> Highest fatality on a weekly basis </h1> 
      <p2> Fatality rate has been monitored on a daily basis to better reflect the fatality pattern and it comes as no surprise that the weekend makes up for almost half the fatalities. With an established nightlife and leading towards the weekend, people in general tend to go out for night activities and it is important that government increase their checks on weekends to prevent these prevailing rates to have a better grasp of the road safety issue as it is correlated to drink driving, one of the major leading causes of road fatality.  </p2>

      <h2 style="text-align: right;> Age and gender classification </h2> 
      <p2 style="text-align: right;> Since 2000, the age group with the highest % of fatalities has always been the middle aged group (40-64), followed by the early adulthood group (26-39). Males also make up more than 60% of fatalities in every state. South Australia recorded 84.61% of males fatalities in just 2021 whereas for Females, the highest fatality rate for 2021 comes from New South Wales with a record 36%. Government should allocate their focus on a targeted demographic to improve on road awareness and safety protocols to reduce fatality rates </p2>
